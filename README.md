# AstroApp

AstroApp is an application written in Swift programming language. It uses Firebase to store and sync data, authenticate users simply and securely using their e-mail or Facebook account, CocoaPods for dependency management.
The application would provide daily horoscope, calculate rising sign (ascendant) and have a daily question that will allow you to level up and unlock new information. You can respond freely in maximum 20 words, and using sentiment analysis it will provide you some information about your sing/day that will cheer you up or just make your day more joyful (like a humoristic horoscope).
I have made some screenshots that will be in the IMGS folder, which contain the menu, status, level up.
